To run the Selenium code (GUI Automation), I used IntelliJ,
and I added a jar as one of my projects External Libraries.
The filename of this jar was:

selenium-server-standalone-3.141.59.jar

and it was downloaded from the Selenium website.  
   
Additionally, the chromedriver executable was downloaded
from the chromedriver website. As you can see in 
MySelenium.java, the chromedriver is expected to be
at the following path:

C:\Users\navarun\Downloads\chromedriver_win32\chromedriver.exe

Please change this path to point to your local copy of chromedriver
before running the Selenium Java code.
